# Contributing

This package is the byte layer: bytes off the band in, named records out. Keep
it that way — it has **zero runtime dependencies** and no I/O, and that's a
feature, not an accident. It runs on-device inside the app.

## What belongs here (and what doesn't)

| Your change | Repo |
|---|---|
| A record type, opcode, event, CRC/framing, GATT constant | **here** |
| A metric, or how a number is computed from records | [analytics](https://github.com/OpenStrap/analytics) |
| Bluetooth reliability, storage, sync, UI | [edge](https://github.com/OpenStrap/edge) |

Nothing in `lib/` may import `dart:io`, do network calls, or pull in a package.
If you need those, your change belongs in edge.

## Protocol findings are the most valuable contribution

A lot of the current event table is empirical guesswork by one person. If you've
worked out a field, an opcode, or an event we don't decode — or found one we
decode *wrongly* — that helps everyone with one of these bands.

Open an issue with:

- The raw frame bytes (hex), as many samples as you have.
- What you think the field is, and at what offset.
- **How you convinced yourself.** This is the important part. "HR at offset 17
  tracked my actual pulse across 40 minutes of wear, and offset 14 didn't" is a
  real answer. Correlating against a known ground truth beats pattern-matching.

Firmware versions differ. If a field only holds on one `histVersion`, say which
one — `parseR24` already routes per-version and that's usually where a new
finding lands.

## Ground rules

**Don't decode something you can't justify.** A wrong field is worse than a
missing one, because it silently poisons every metric downstream. If a value is
only *probably* right, gate it behind a plausibility check the way
`_physiologicallyPlausible` does (HR 25–230, |g|² 0.25–3.24) rather than
trusting it outright.

**Never guess a value to fill a gap.** If a record doesn't decode, return
`null`. The app archives undecodable records rather than discarding them, so a
`null` here is recoverable later; a fabricated value is not.

**Some opcodes are dangerous.** `dangerousCmds` exists for a reason — force-trim,
reboot, power-cycle, firmware load. Don't wire any of them into an automatic
path, and don't add new ones without a very clear justification in the PR.

## Tests

Run from the repo root:

```bash
dart pub get
dart analyze
dart test
```

For a fresh clone or T3 worktree, `bash scripts/setup.sh` prepares dependencies
from any working directory. `bash scripts/setup.sh --check` also runs the analyzer
with fatal info diagnostics and the full test suite with two workers. Setup uses
the installed Dart SDK and preserves this checkout's ignored lockfile after its
first resolution. See AGENTS.md for SDK selection and importing the T3 actions.

Two things guard every change:

- **`decode_parity_cases.json`** — 2934 cases checked against the frozen
  oracle. This file *is* the oracle now — it was generated from a TypeScript
  reference implementation (`ts/`) that was later deleted once parity was
  locked in (still recoverable from git history if you need to regenerate
  cases from scratch), but nothing in `dart test` spawns node/tsc against it
  any more. If you change a decoder and parity breaks, either your change is
  wrong or the fixture needs regenerating — work out which, and say so in the
  PR.
- **`dart_header.json`** — 550 hand-checked R24 header cases.

Both are tracked in-repo and run in CI. A third set replays
`whoop_hist.jsonl`, a real band capture kept *beside* the repo rather than in
it; those tests skip automatically when it's absent, which is what CI does.

New record types or opcodes should come with test cases from real frames.

## Pull requests

- Branch off `main`, one logical change per PR.
- Say how you verified it against real hardware.
- No `Co-Authored-By` trailers.

## Scope

Facts about a wire protocol, worked out by observing your own device, are fine.
Vendor source code, firmware, decompiled binaries, and material from other
reverse-engineering projects whose licences don't permit reuse are not — don't
paste them into code, comments, commits, or PR descriptions.
